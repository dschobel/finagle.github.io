The team working on [Finagle](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/), [Finatra](https://twitter.github.io/finatra/), and related libraries met last week and did our planning for the next three months. These are high-level goals and as such, have varying degrees of confidence and certainty.

#### In the spirit of Spring cleaning:

* Remove Netty 3 support from most protocols. We expect to complete most protocols, however HTTP is a long shot.
* Upgrade [libthrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) to 0.10.0 from the ancient fork of 0.5.0.
* Deprecate and then remove modules that are unsupported or exist in a zombie-like state. This includes [ostrich](https://github.com/twitter/ostrich), [finagle-ostrich4](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/develop/finagle-ostrich4), [finagle-kestrel](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/develop/finagle-kestrel), [finagle-stream](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/develop/finagle-stream), [finagle-native](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/develop/finagle-native), [finagle-mdns](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/tree/develop/finagle-mdns), and [util-eval](https://github.com/twitter/util/tree/develop/util-eval).
* Minimize dependencies on [twitter-commons](https://github.com/twitter/commons) with the eventual goal of removing all of them.

#### For those interested in the shiny and new:

* Get HTTP/2 to production level quality so that it becomes the default HTTP implementation.
* Continued SSL/TLS work, including STARTTLS support.
* Finish the work on [Tunables](https://github.com/twitter/util/tree/develop/util-tunable) such that service owners can dynamically change configuration.
* Finish the work on [MethodBuilder](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/develop/finagle-core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/client/MethodBuilder.scala) as a replacement for ClientBuilder and the foundation for more enhancements.

#### For those who like their tools polished:

* Throughput improvements via changes to Futures, defaulting to the Netty 4 native transport, Netty 4 buffer pooling, and more.
* Switch the default [load balancer](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Clients.html#load-balancing) to Aperture.
* Switch the default [failure accrual](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Clients.html#failure-accrual) policy to success rate instead of consecutive failures.
* Move TwitterServer to use [slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/) for logging and begin the process of moving Util and Finagle.
* A handful of Scrooge changes to make the Scala generated code more composable, fixing [ResponseClassification](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Clients.html#response-classification) for servers for example.

I realize details here are sparse and certainly not comprehensive. Please ask questions on the mailing list and hopefully we can help clarify if you would like to know more.
