The August release is here and brings a major version bump for both Finagle and Util to v7! :cake::cake::cake:

Over the last few years Finagle has had an extensive internal overhaul to support Netty 4 along with a rewrite of all its protocols so now as the last traces of Netty 3 have been removed from finagle-core we felt the time was right to celebrate with a shiny new major version.

(Fun fact: Finagle's last major version bump came almost 5 years ago, a simpler time when 'Gangnam Style' was still dominating the charts.)

Without further ado, here are the highlights:

[Finagle 7.0.0][finagle], [Finatra 2.12.0][finatra], [Scrooge 4.19.0][scrooge], [TwitterServer 1.31.0][twitterserver], and [Util 7.0.0][util].


### Finagle ###

### Scrooge ###

  object allocations. [4cd9ee7](https://github.com/twitter/scrooge/commit/4cd9ee7017d75cec068f5acf14b97bc2955474ec)

    of execution for timer tasks. [7c8425d](https://github.com/twitter/util/commit/7c8425d95e45771ff88e8d23857f9f8026bb09aa)
